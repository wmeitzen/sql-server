/*
The SQL functions (below) and command (at the very bottom)
generates DROP and CREATE commands for all PKs, FKs, and
indexes in dependency order below a user-specified TABLE_NAME.
It does not execute the DROP or CREATE commands; it only generates the TSQL code.
I used it to change about 300 datetime2 columns to datetime on a database with 11 levels of dependencies.
Set your SSMS output to "results to text," with up to 8000 characters per column.

Function deps_it_depends:
Given a schema, table name (as a starting point), and hard-coded 1,
return a list of all database objects and dependencies.
Slightly expanded from Phil Factor's code. (His method of gathering the dependencies
is pretty ingenious!)
The hard-coded 1 is to retrieve dependencies "upward," and 0 is "downward." I only used 1
for my use case.

Function deps_generate_create_and_drop_index:
Given a schema and index name or PK name, return the code to drop and create the object.

Function deps_generate_create_and_drop_fk:
Given a schema and FK name, return the code to drop and create the object.

/*
The SQL command below generates DROP and CREATE commands for all PKs, FKs, and
indexes in dependency order below your specified TABLE_NAME.
It does not execute the DROP or CREATE commands; it only generates them.
I used it to change datetime2 datatypes to datetime on a database with 11 levels of dependencies.
It worked pretty well for me, but I still suggest you test it on a backup of your target database first.
You'll need to run the SELECT command twice: once to generate DROP commands, and once to generate CREATE commands.
I recommend generating/copying/pasting DROP commands, enter your dependency change
("alter table TABLE_NAME alter column DATATYPE not null"),
generating/copying/pasting CREATE commands, saving the file, all before running the script.
